<h2 style="text-align: center; color: black"><b>About Us</b></h2>
<p>We started in 2020, we envisioned a platform that could leverage technology to place users' ever-changing needs first through interactions and connections among them. We hoped that this open platform could provide equal opportunities and empower all for a better life.
Therefore, we created a 100% interactive mobile Internet platform and provided e-commerce services to enable users to discover interesting and value-for-money products. Unlike the conventional search model used by existing global peers, we engages our users through a personalized recommendation model.
In new 3 years, we pave the way to becoming a global and institutional technology platform.
At here, user satisfaction is the most important KPI of our employees. "I hope our team wakes up feeling anxious every day, never because of share price volatilities, but because of their constant fear of users departing if we are unable to anticipate and meet users' changing needs", said the founder and CEO.
As of a goal to September 2023, our last-twelve-month Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) is US$117.5 billion, connecting 536.2 million annual active buyers and more than 3.6 million merchants.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: black"><b>Benefit All</b></h2>
<p>This is determined by the era in which "new e-commerce" was born. When the Internet was first introduced to China twenty years ago, it was accessible only to a select few - the more educated and the more affluent. When we launched Pinduoduo in 2015, whether you were in the city or the countryside, whether you were a professor or a farmer, mobile Internet was equally accessible to all. As the new platform born of this time, our mission has been to serve all and benefit all. From day one, we have devoted ourselves to this mission, working hard to increase the income of farmers by bringing agricultural products to cities directly, while providing savings to the urban population. This effort was the most important driving force behind the growth of our platform. Thereafter, through the C2M (Consumer-to-Manufacturer) model of direct sales from factories, we have improved the value-for-money proposition of the merchandise on our platform, thus providing affordable and better-quality household items to all. This marked another significant step towards our mission of benefiting all.</p>
